# 📞 Customer Service Dashboard - Power BI 

This project aims to create a Power BI dashboard to evaluate SLA performance, revenue trends, and team efficiency using anonymized call center data from 2018 to 2021. The dashboard supports the regional director in making data-driven decisions to improve customer service performance and enhance operational efficiency.

Note: This dashboard was created as part of the certification exam for the Data Analyst course.

## 📊 Dashboard Features
This Power BI dashboard is organized into three main analysis axes:

1. **Customer Service Overview**
   - Total number of calls by sector, site, and weekday
   - Average call duration and wait time
   - SLA compliance rate (Within SLA vs Outside SLA)
   - Key metrics such as highest revenue and call center performance

2. **Revenue Insights**
   - Total and average revenue per manager and year
   - Revenue trends from 2018 to 2021
   - Revenue breakdown by sector and team
   - Filters to explore by month, weekday, and call type

3. **Manager & Employee Performance**
   - Number of calls managed per manager
   - Average wait time per employee
   - Sector and time-based filters to compare team efficiency
