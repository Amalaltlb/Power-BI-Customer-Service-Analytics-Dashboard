# Power BI Customer Service Analytics Dashboard

This project was completed as part of my Data Analyst certification. It involves analyzing anonymized customer service data from 2018-2021 to assess performance, revenue, and employee efficiency. The analysis includes SLA compliance, year-over-year revenue trends, and performance evaluations for employees and managers using Power BI.

## Key Features:
- **SLA Compliance Analysis**: Analyzed and visualized call data to determine the compliance with Service Level Agreements (SLA) by creating a new column for SLA compliance (Within SLA or Outside SLA) based on waiting times.
- **Revenue Analysis**: Conducted year-over-year revenue analysis based on call data, evaluating key revenue drivers across different sectors and teams.
- **Employee and Manager Performance**: Evaluated individual employee and manager performance, including call handling times and team performance to aid in data-driven decision-making.
- **Dynamic Dashboard**: Created an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs), call data, revenue trends, and SLA compliance across different axes.

## Tools and Techniques:
- **Power BI**: Utilized Power Query for data transformation, data modeling, and dashboard creation.
- **Data Modeling**: Cleaned and prepped raw data, including handling missing values, outliers, and creating new variables (e.g., SLA Compliance).
- **Data Analysis**: Conducted analysis on customer service metrics, revenue, and employee performance using Power BIâ€™s visualization features.

This project demonstrates my ability to analyze large datasets, transform and clean data, and create actionable insights through interactive dashboards, ultimately supporting data-driven decisions.

Note: This dashboard was created as part of the certification exam for the Data Analyst course, focusing on analyzing anonymized customer service data and providing insights for performance, revenue, and efficiency.
